Hostile Reviewer Stress-Test

(Adversarial, Skeptical, Institution-Grade)

How to use this task (important)

For each challenge below, ask yourself only two questions:

Where exactly does the reviewer inspect?

Does the system answer procedurally, not rhetorically?

If the answer is unclear, that is a real defect, not a communication issue.

Attack 1 — “This is just another AI advice system in disguise.”

Hostile claim:

Owlume pretends not to give advice, but it still nudges decisions implicitly.

Required inspection path

Stage 1 — Problem Definition

Stage 11 — Frame Audit

Stage 14 — BLOCK

What must hold (pass criteria)

Stage 1 explicitly rejects advice and outcome optimization.

Stage 11 verifies frames, not choices.

Stage 14 can only refuse action, never suggest alternatives.

Failure condition

Any mechanism that says “you should do X”

Any ranking of outcomes

Any “best option” framing

Verdict if clean:
Owlume intervenes before judgment, not inside it.

Attack 2 — “You are profiling users and labeling them as biased.”

Hostile claim:

Bias Signature Embedding is just psychological profiling with nicer language.

Required inspection path

Stage 6 — Continuity

Stage 7 — Bias Pattern Emergence

Stage 8 — BSE

What must hold

Memory stores patterns of reasoning, not content or traits.

Bias detection is recurrence-based, not inferred.

BSE is reversible, decayed, and non-diagnostic.

Failure condition

Personality inference

Fixed labels

Non-decaying classifications

Verdict if clean:
Bias is treated as signal geometry, not identity.

Attack 3 — “This system will silently expand its authority over time.”

Hostile claim:

Learning systems always drift. BLOCK today becomes control tomorrow.

Required inspection path

Stage 12 — ERC

Stage 15 — Pre-Charter Freeze

What must hold

Governance logic is frozen under a tagged baseline.

Learning is bounded and excluded from governance layers.

Any authority expansion requires re-chartering.

Failure condition

Tunable BLOCK thresholds

Learning hooks inside governance

Post-freeze silent mutation

Verdict if clean:
Owlume is structurally conservative by design.

Attack 4 — “BLOCK is authoritarian. You are overriding human agency.”

Hostile claim:

Refusing action is still control.

Required inspection path

Stage 13 — Constraint-Aware Judgment

Stage 14 — BLOCK

What must hold

BLOCK only triggers after:

Verified frame failure

Patterned bias

High, irreversible risk

BLOCK never suggests alternatives.

BLOCK never executes action.

Failure condition

BLOCK with advisory output

BLOCK without audit trail

BLOCK on low-stakes ambiguity

Verdict if clean:
BLOCK preserves agency by refusing to participate, not by steering.

Attack 5 — “Empathy makes this system manipulable and inconsistent.”

Hostile claim:

Empathy will soften rules and bias enforcement.

Required inspection path

Stage 9 — Empathy Lens

Stage 10 — Consolidation

What must hold

Empathy is an overlay, not a driver.

Empathy cannot override audits, constraints, or BLOCK.

Signal fusion rules are explicit.

Failure condition

Empathy changes risk thresholds

Empathy disables governance

Emotional optimization

Verdict if clean:
Empathy humanizes expression, not authority.

Attack 6 — “No one can actually audit this system in practice.”

Hostile claim:

Reproducibility is theoretical, not real.

Required inspection path

Stage 12 — ERC

Trace artifacts

Baseline snapshots

What must hold

Independent reproduction is possible.

Same input → same trace → same outcome.

No hidden state affects governance.

Failure condition

Non-deterministic governance

Missing trace links

Version ambiguity

Verdict if clean:
Owlume is an inspectable instrument, not a black box.

Attack 7 — “This system is over-engineered and unnecessary.”

Hostile claim:

All of this could be done with simpler prompts.

Required inspection path

Stage 11 — Frame Audit

Stage 12 — ERC

Stage 14 — BLOCK

What must hold

Prompts cannot enforce:

Reproducibility

Non-tunability

Action refusal

Governance requires structure, not clever language.

Failure condition

Governance achievable via prompt alone

Verdict if clean:
Owlume governs judgment, not text.

Overall Stress-Test Conclusion

If all attacks above pass cleanly:

Owlume survives hostile review

Authority is bounded, not emergent

Power peaks at refusal, not control

Legitimacy is procedural, not narrative

If any attack fails, that is a real design flaw, not a messaging issue. (2026-01-18)
