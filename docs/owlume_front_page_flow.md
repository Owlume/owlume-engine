# 🦉 Owlume — Front Page Flow (Final Version)

## Usage Context  
This file defines Owlume’s **core brand spine** — the lines that anchor every public-facing experience, including:  
- The **GPT Store overview** and **app introduction panel**.  
- The **Golden Set Challenge headers**, ensuring every test demo reinforces brand identity.  
- Future **web landing pages** or **investor decks**, maintaining verbal consistency.  

Any updates to tagline, tone, or promise must begin here and cascade outward (GPT, website, docs).
