# 🧭 Owlume Agent — Concept Overview (Draft)

**Version:** v0.1  
**Stage:** To be initiated post-MVP traction (Stage 4)  
**Prepared by:** Owlume + GPT-5 Partner  
**Purpose:** Define the role, timing, and architecture of an autonomous ChatGPT Agent that augments Owlume’s Clarity-Driven ecosystem.

---

## 1. Purpose

To transition Owlume from a reflection tool → to an *autonomous clarity companion* that helps users maintain and deepen reflective habits with minimal friction.

> **Vision:** The Owlume Agent monitors, learns, and nudges — guiding each user’s clarity journey with precision and empathy.

## 2. Core Role

| Function | Description | Relation to Core System |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| 🪞 **Clarity Guardian** | Tracks user’s Clarity Gain (CG) trends and flags drops or plateaus. | Reads from DilemmaNet logs and CDE metrics. |
| 🔁 **Learning Conduit** | Feeds anonymized interaction data into DilemmaNet for retraining. | Keeps the dataset fresh and human-grounded. |
| 🧭 **Adaptive Guide** | Adjusts voice overlays, empathy levels, and question styles over time. | Interfaces with Elenx engine. |
| ⏰ **Reflection Orchestrator** | Suggests or schedules reflections via gentle nudges or moment-based triggers. | Syncs with user behavior / calendar. |

---

## 3. Operational Model

### Phase 1 — **Passive Observation**
- The Agent listens, logs, and summarizes clarity trends.  
- No user-facing behavior.  
- Primary goal: validate data fidelity and detect useful triggers.

### Phase 2 — **Active Assistance**
- Begins nudging based on reflection frequency and CG deltas.  
- Can initiate reflection sessions contextually.  
- Example: “You’ve gained clarity mostly in analytical areas — shall we balance with relational ones?”

### Phase 3 — **Autonomous Reflection Partner**
- Fully integrates empathy modulation, voice adaptation, and predictive scheduling.  
- Learns user’s unique cognitive rhythm — when to challenge vs. support.

## 4. Architecture Hooks (Conceptual)

User Input → Elenx Engine → Clarity Gain Metrics
↘ ↘
DilemmaNet ← Owlume Agent
↖
Empathy Lens


**Agent Interfaces:**
1. **CDE Metrics API:** Read CG deltas, reflection count, time since last session.  
2. **Elenx Hooks:** Adjust mode/voice configuration dynamically.  
3. **DilemmaNet Sync:** Push anonymized summaries for ongoing learning.  
4. **Notification Layer:** Trigger daily or moment-based nudges.

## 5. Design Principles

| Principle | Application |
|------------|--------------|
| 🧠 **Clarity First** | Every action must increase clarity, never noise. |
| 🕊️ **Low Friction** | The Agent assists without feeling intrusive. |
| 💎 **Interpretability** | Users can see *why* a nudge or change occurred. |
| 💬 **Human Resonance** | Tone always reflects empathy, not automation. |
| 🔒 **Privacy by Design** | No raw text stored without consent; metadata only for metrics. |

---

## 6. Triggers (Examples)

| Trigger | Action |
|----------|---------|
| CG ↓ for 3 sessions | Suggest different questioning mode. |
| No reflection for 7 days | Send gentle nudge: “Ready for a quick clarity check?” |
| Spike in empathy-weighted questions | Invite deeper relational reflection. |
| User achieves 10 reflections | Celebrate streak with “Clarity Momentum” insight. |

---

## 7. Future Considerations

- Integrate with ChatGPT’s **AI Agent framework** for persistence and background task handling.  
- Explore minimal local memory for personalized context (user’s clarity profile).  
- Potential cross-app integration (email, meetings, journaling apps).  
- Ensure explainable Agent actions (transparent reasoning).

---

## 8. Current Status

🚧 *Not active in MVP (Stage 3).  
To be revisited after ≥100–500 real reflections logged.*

---

**Summary Insight:**  
> The Owlume Agent should not *replace* reflection — it should *protect and amplify* it.  
> Its role is to guard clarity, not automate thought.
