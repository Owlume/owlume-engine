# 🦉 Owlume — Onboarding Flow (v1)

## Purpose
Guide first-time users through the reflection process clearly and gently, ensuring immediate understanding of how Owlume works and what “clarity” means in practice.

---

## Step 0 — Welcome
**Welcome to Owlume.**
> Most AI gives answers. Owlume reveals what you’re missing.

A simple, reflective prompt appears:
> “What decision, plan, or dilemma are you thinking about right now?”

---

## Step 1 — Paste a Dilemma
Users paste or describe any situation, e.g.  
> “I’m unsure whether to expand my team this quarter.”

---

## Step 2 — See Blind Spots
Elenx analyzes reasoning patterns and reveals unseen distortions — assumptions, risks, or biases — framed through **Questioncraft Matrix Modes × Principles**.

A Clarity Card appears showing:
- **Detected Mode** & **Principle**
- **Empathy state**
- **Top 3 Blind-Spot Questions**

---

## Step 3 — Gain Clarity
Owlume measures **Clarity Gain (C Δ)** before and after reflection.  
A short summary explains what shifted:
> “You explored more possibilities and balanced evidence with empathy.”

---

## Step 4 — Gentle Daily Ritual
After the first session, Owlume offers a gentle nudge:
> “One minute of clarity today keeps blind spots away.”

These daily reflections build the habit — and feed DilemmaNet’s learning loop.
