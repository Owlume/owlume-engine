# 🦉 Owlume Voice Map (v1.0)

**Purpose:**  
Define the voice architecture that makes every Owlume message — from App Name to in-chat tone — feel human, intelligent, and trustworthy.  
Each layer expresses a different *mode of clarity* in the user’s journey.

| Keywords | illumination · insight · reflection | Establishes brand as guide, not guru. |

## 2️⃣ Long Description → **Conceptual Clarity**
**Text:**  
> *No matter how clever your prompts, most AI mirrors your thinking.  
> Owlume reveals what you’re missing before they cost you.
