# ðŸ¦‰ Owlume â€” Instrumentation Ownership Plan (v1.0)

## Purpose
To define **who** builds, **how** data flows, and **what** roles maintain the instrumentation that measures Owlumeâ€™s daily ritual frequency.  
Instrumentation ensures that every reflection, nudge, and return interaction is *measurable*, *adaptive*, and *growth-driven.*

- Event logging (session_start â†’ followup_completed)
- Data aggregation (WRU, NAR, TTQ, R48, PCS, etc.)
