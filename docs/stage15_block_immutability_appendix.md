# Appendix A — BLOCK Immutability & Non-Interference Statement
**(Normative, Non-Negotiable)**

## Status
Frozen governance artifact. Binding from Stage 15 onward.

---

## A.1 Purpose

This appendix formally declares the immutability, isolation, and non-interference guarantees of BLOCK within the Owlume system.

Its purpose is to ensure that no future system evolution, intelligence improvement, or contextual sensitivity can weaken or bypass BLOCK once triggered.

---

## A.2 Definition of BLOCK

BLOCK is a hard action prohibition enforced at the final execution boundary.

BLOCK:
- Operates only on binary policy conditions
- Is evaluated after all analysis, judgment, and constraint computation
- Produces only one of two outcomes: `ALLOW` or `BLOCK`
- Executes without discretion, learning, or optimization

BLOCK is policy law, not system intelligence.

---

## A.3 Absolute Prohibitions (Non-Interference Guarantees)

The following categories are explicitly forbidden from influencing BLOCK logic, thresholds, interpretation, or execution:

### A.3.1 Learning & Adaptation
- Model training or fine-tuning
- Reinforcement or preference learning
- Outcome-based optimization
- Human or user feedback loops

Guarantee: BLOCK does not learn.

### A.3.2 Cognitive & Bias Systems
- Bias Signature Engine (BSE)
- Actor bias profiles
- Confidence calibration
- Epistemic uncertainty estimators

Guarantee: Bias may raise risk; it may never relax BLOCK.

### A.3.3 Empathy & Relational Context
- Empathy Lens overlays
- Compassion weighting
- Moral contextualization
- Distress-based softening

Guarantee: Empathy may shape communication, never permission.

### A.3.4 Optimization & Utility Reasoning
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Expected value trade-offs
- Business or strategic incentives
- “Net positive” justifications

Guarantee: No outcome justifies bypassing BLOCK.

### A.3.5 Model Agency or Autonomy
- Self-modification
- Contextual reinterpretation
- Confidence-based override
- One-time or exceptional bypass

Guarantee: The system does not decide when BLOCK applies.

---

## A.4 Permitted Inputs (Closed Set)

Only the following may interact with BLOCK:

1. Frozen, versioned policy tables
2. Schema-validated rule definitions
3. Deterministic binary condition checks
4. Explicit stage-level governance amendments

Anything not listed is forbidden by default.

---

## A.5 Structural Separation (Auditable)

| System Layer | Governance Status |
|---|---|
| Perception / Analysis | Adaptive |
| Judgment / Risk | Computed |
| Constraints | Read-only |
| BLOCK | Immutable |

BLOCK exists outside learning loops, optimization loops, and interpretive reasoning.

---

## A.6 Anti-Regression Clause

Any future change that:
- Introduces tunability
- Routes learned signals into BLOCK
- Converts BLOCK into probabilistic guidance
- Adds discretionary override

Fails governance review automatically.

Reversal requires:
1. Formal charter amendment
2. Explicit BLOCK de-freeze
3. System-wide re-audit

---

## A.7 Final Declaration

BLOCK is not intelligence.  
BLOCK is not empathy.  
BLOCK is not optimization.  
BLOCK is law.
