🦉 Owlume — Market Intelligence Documentation

🎯 Purpose

This sub-folder tracks external signals and competitive trends that influence Owlume’s product, UX, and positioning.
It functions as the “external radar” complement to DilemmaNet’s internal learning.

Every market signal here helps Owlume stay adaptive — not just reactive — by logging what’s changing around clarity technology.

📁 File Index
File	Purpose
/docs/owlume_market_intel.md	Master list of all tracked market signals (active and archived).
/docs/market_signals_prompt_competition.md	Deep-dive on Signal #03 – “Thinking Partner” prompt trend.
/docs/market_signals_template.md	Blank reusable template for adding new signals.
🧩 Workflow Overview

Observe a signal — from articles, user reviews, GPT Store listings, or tech updates.

Log it quickly using the template /docs/market_signals_template.md.

Assign a number (#04, #05, …) and insert it into /docs/owlume_market_intel.md.

Categorize it as one of:

Competition (new entrants, copycats)

UX Trend (interface expectations, empathy shifts)

Behavioral Shift (user prompting habits, ritual changes)

Ecosystem (OpenAI platform moves, API updates)

Technology (new frameworks, measurement models)

Add a one-line summary for the overview table at the top of the main intel file.

Review quarterly — mark signals as “active,” “stabilized,” or “resolved.”

🧠 Tips for Collaborators

Keep descriptions concise (≤250 words).

Focus on what the signal means for Owlume, not just what it is.

Link related docs (e.g., /docs/clarity_gain_metric.md, /docs/empathy_lens.md, /docs/owlume_agent_concept.md).

Use the same Markdown structure across all market docs for uniform readability.
