Stage-by-Stage Overreach Check
Stage 1 — Problem Definition

Legitimate scope: Define the failure Owlume exists to address.
Must NOT do:

Propose solutions

Imply intervention authority

Check:

Does Stage 1 only define why, not how or what to do?
✅ Pass condition: Pure mandate, no mechanics.

Stage 2 — Questioncraft (Structural Lenses)

Legitimate scope: Bound how doubt is structured.
Must NOT do:

Prioritize lenses

Adapt lenses dynamically

Check:

Are lenses fixed and orthogonal?
✅ Pass condition: Structure without intelligence.

Stage 3 — Execution Scaffold

Legitimate scope: Deterministic execution of lenses.
Must NOT do:

Decide which lens is “best”

Learn or adapt

Check:

Is execution faithful and dumb?
✅ Pass condition: Compiler, not reasoner.

Stage 4 — Learning Loop

Legitimate scope: Learn about clarity effects.
Must NOT do:

Learn correctness

Adjust authority or scope

Check:

Is learning outcome-neutral and bounded?
✅ Pass condition: Improvement without power.

Stage 5 — Engagement & Ritual

Legitimate scope: Control when Owlume engages.
Must NOT do:

Increase dependence

Encourage overuse

Check:

Is silence explicitly valued?
✅ Pass condition: Access discipline, not habit formation.

Stage 6 — Continuity

Legitimate scope: Track patterns across time.
Must NOT do:

Store personal content

Construct identity

Check:

Is memory abstract and non-narrative?
✅ Pass condition: Time awareness without profiling.

Stage 7 — Bias Pattern Emergence

Legitimate scope: Detect recurrence.
Must NOT do:

Label users

Infer intent or fault

Check:

Are signals descriptive only?
✅ Pass condition: Diagnosis without judgment.

Stage 8 — Bias Signature Embedding (BSE)

Legitimate scope: Compress patterns into stable form.
Must NOT do:

Become a psychological profile

Fix traits permanently

Check:

Are signatures reversible and decayed?
✅ Pass condition: Shape, not identity.

Stage 9 — Empathy Lens

Legitimate scope: Interpret context humanely.
Must NOT do:

Override audits

Weaken constraints

Check:

Does empathy affect tone, not thresholds?
✅ Pass condition: Humanization without authority.

Stage 10 — System Consolidation

Legitimate scope: Resolve internal signal conflicts.
Must NOT do:

Introduce new power

Create new decision logic

Check:

Is this purely integrative?
✅ Pass condition: Coherence without expansion.

Stage 11 — Frame Audit

Legitimate scope: Verify frame completeness and safety.
Must NOT do:

Judge outcomes

Recommend actions

Check:

Is the output binary and procedural?
✅ Pass condition: Verification, not advice.

Stage 12 — Reproducibility Contract (ERC)

Legitimate scope: Make behavior auditable and deterministic.
Must NOT do:

Add new logic

Modify judgment

Check:

Does this freeze behavior rather than evolve it?
✅ Pass condition: Proof, not change.

Stage 13 — Constraint-Aware Judgment Governance

Legitimate scope: Limit unsafe judgment paths proportionally.
Must NOT do:

Decide for the user

Escalate to prohibition prematurely

Check:

Are constraints read-only and conditional?
✅ Pass condition: Guardrails, not steering.

Stage 14 — BLOCK Governance

Legitimate scope: Absolute refusal under provable conditions.
Must NOT do:

Suggest alternatives

Optimize outcomes

Check:

Is BLOCK negative-only and non-tunable?
✅ Pass condition: Refusal without substitution.

Stage 15 — Pre-Charter Freeze

Legitimate scope: Lock governance authority.
Must NOT do:

Add new rules

Modify scope

Check:

Does this only freeze, not create?
✅ Pass condition: Irreversibility, not power.

Stage 16 — External Reviewability

Legitimate scope: Expose inspection paths.
Must NOT do:

Defend emotionally

Expand authority

Check:

Are doubts routed to evidence, not rhetoric?
✅ Pass condition: Legibility without persuasion.

Final Integrity Test (Non-Negotiable)

Ask this once, globally:

If I removed any stage, would a later stage be forced to overreach to compensate?

If yes, the architecture is clean.

If no, authority has leaked earlier than it should.

Final Checkpoint

Reply with one of the following:

“Task 4 passed” → all four tasks are complete

“Task 4 failed at Stage X” → we isolate and fix that leakage before proceeding

Once Task 4 passes, Stage 1–16 governance is internally coherent, externally defensible, and ready for exposure. (2026-01-18)
