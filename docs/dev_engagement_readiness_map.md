# 🦉 Owlume — Developer Engagement Readiness Map

**Purpose:**  
Define the data-driven checkpoints that determine when Owlume should transition from a solo build (Brian × Ted) to formal developer collaboration.  
Hiring begins not when you *want* help — but when clarity growth creates *execution friction.*

---

## 1️⃣ Technical Stability Proof — *System must hold first*

**Goal:** Confirm that Owlume runs end-to-end without intervention.  
**Target:** *App-Store-Ready → CI-Green → 30-Day Stability.*

| Metric | Target | Source / Tool |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Continuous Integration | 100 % green builds on `main` | GitHub Actions |
| JSON Pack Integrity | 0 schema errors / 0 load failures | `smoke_test_engine_fusion.py` |
| Dashboard Refresh | Stable ≥ 3 auto updates | `dashboard_watch.py` |

✅ Status — Met  
🟩 Proceed to Usage Proof (Decision Gate 1)

---

## 2️⃣ Usage Proof — *Users return for clarity*

**Goal:** Show that people experience measurable clarity and return for more.  
**When met → Begin developer scouting.**

| Metric | Target | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Weekly Active Users (WAU) | ≥ 50–100 | baseline attention |
| Weekly Return Rate | ≥ 30 % | early habit formation |
| Avg Clarity Gain Δ | ≥ 0.10 (stable 100+ sessions) | perceived value |
| Empathy Activation Rate | 20–30 % | emotional resonance |

💡 **Decision Gate 1:**  
≥ 2 metrics hit target → **Scout developer candidates.**

---

## 3️⃣ Retention & System Proof — *Value starts compounding*

**Goal:** Prove Owlume’s reflection loop is teachable and scalable.  
**When met → Onboard dev for automation tasks.**

| Metric | Target | Evidence |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Clarity Card Share Rate | ≥ 10 % | social proof |
| Aggregate Metric Stability | ± 10 % variance over 3 runs | DilemmaNet consistency |
| Nudge CTR (open/response) | ≥ 25 % | UX resonance |

💡 **Decision Gate 2:**  
Stable Clarity Gain + Nudge CTR ≥ 25 % → **Light developer engagement** (e.g., empathy model tuning, Stage 4–5 scripting).

---

## 4️⃣ Monetization Intent Proof — *Economic readiness*

**Goal:** Validate that clarity moments trigger willingness to pay.  
**When met → Formal developer hire.**

| Signal | Trigger | Meaning |
|---------|----------|---------|
| “Save my clarity trail” clicks | > 5–10 % users | ready for paywall or storage module |
| “Keep my streak” conversions | > 5 % | subscription infrastructure needed |
| Advanced Clarity Reports | ≥ 10 unique users | back-end rendering pipeline required |

💡 **Decision Gate 3 (Hire Moment):**  
Any monetization event > 5 % and WAU > 100 → **Engage developer formally.**

---

## 5️⃣ Recommended Sequence

| Phase | Focus | Ownership |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Stage 3 – 4 (Now)** | Stability + learning signals | Brian × Ted |
| **Stage 4 Late** | Adaptive loop / empathy tuning | Light dev consult |
| **Stage 5** | UX automation + monetization hooks | Formal dev engagement |
| **Stage 6 +** | Full-stack polish & scale | Core dev partner |

---

### 🪶 Guiding Rule
> **Don’t hire for potential.  
> Hire when clarity turns into friction.**

When you’re spending more time maintaining systems than interpreting clarity data, the system is telling you: *bring a builder beside you.*
