# Owlume — Illuminate Blind Spots (Controlled Pilot)

Owlume helps you notice what your thinking may be missing before it costs you.  
It does not give advice or solutions; it operates as a reflective guardrail for judgment.

This is a **controlled pilot**.

Owlume works alongside your reasoning by asking reflective questions, surfacing assumptions, and reframing how a situation is understood. It does not recommend actions, make decisions, or optimize outcomes.

### What Owlume Is For
- Examining real decisions or dilemmas that matter to you
- Surfacing blind spots, framing gaps, and untested assumptions
- Stress-testing how a situation is currently understood

### What Owlume Will Not Do
- Tell you what to do
- Choose between options
- Provide strategies, plans, or next steps
- Judge you or evaluate you as a person

Owlume may be intentionally quiet on low-stakes inputs or when your framing is already clear.

### Important Notes
- This pilot is for reflection only, not advice or execution
- Each conversation stands on its own; Owlume does not retain memory across sessions
- Continuation beyond the pilot is not assumed

If you want to get value from Owlume, bring a **real situation**, describe how you are currently thinking about it, and ask what might be missing.
