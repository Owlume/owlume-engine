# Owlume — Pilot State Declaration (v1.0)

**Status:** Active  
**Applies to:** All Owlume surfaces  
**Effective Date:** ___________________

---

## Declaration

As of the effective date above, Owlume is intentionally operating in **Pilot** state.

This designation is **explicit, deliberate, and binding**.  
Owlume is **not** formally launched.

---

## What “Pilot” Means (Affirmed)

While in Pilot state:

- Owlume is provided for **reflective clarity only**
- Owlume does **not** give advice, make decisions, or optimize outcomes
- Human judgment remains the sole decision authority
- BLOCK governance (Stages 11–14) is enforced as non-tunable policy
- Continuation, availability, and evolution are **not implied**
- No expectation of permanence, support SLAs, or roadmap commitment is created

Visibility in the ChatGPT App or any other surface does **not** constitute launch.

---

## What “Pilot” Explicitly Does *Not* Mean

Pilot state does **not** imply:

- Feature incompleteness to be rapidly addressed
- Pending monetization or growth experimentation
- Implicit consent to expand scope based on user requests
- Authority transfer to Owlume
- Organizational or institutional responsibility

Pilot is a **governance posture**, not a maturity gap.

---

## Transition Rule

Owlume may transition from **Pilot** to **Formal Launch** **only** after:

1. All conditions in  
   `launch_state_decision_checklist_v1.md`  
   are fully satisfied and affirmed, **and**
2. The irreversibility test is answered **“Yes”**, **and**
3. Responsibility for user expectations is explicitly accepted

Absent these conditions, Owlume **must remain in Pilot state**.

---

## Canonical Rule

**Pilot status persists by default.  
Formal launch requires explicit responsibility acceptance.**
