# Owlume — ChatGPT App Launch Charter (Pilot v1.0)

## 1. Purpose of This Launch

The purpose of this launch is to introduce Owlume to external users **as a controlled pilot**, in order to:

- Validate Owlume’s role as a reflective judgment discipline
- Observe real-world reasoning patterns under cognitive load
- Confirm governance integrity (Stages 11–14) under live usage
- Collect high-signal qualitative feedback without scale pressure

This launch is **explicitly not** intended to test growth, monetization, or feature completeness.

---

## 2. Canonical Product Promise (Locked)

The following sentence is **canonical and non-negotiable** for this pilot:

> **“Owlume helps you notice what your thinking may be missing before it costs you.  
> It does not give advice or solutions; it operates as a reflective guardrail for judgment.”**

This wording must be used **verbatim** across:

- ChatGPT App description
- Onboarding text
- Pilot explanations
- Reviewer or tester briefings

No paraphrasing or reinterpretation is permitted during the pilot phase.

---

## 3. Launch Surface

- **Primary surface:** ChatGPT App (GPT-based interface)
- **Mode:** Alongside the user’s reasoning, not embedded in execution
- **Interaction form:** Conversational reflection only

No standalone application, external UI, workflow integration, or automation is included in this launch.

---

## 4. Scope (What Is Included)

This pilot includes:

- Reflection on user-provided, real-world dilemmas
- Surfacing blind spots, framing gaps, assumptions, and risks
- Question-based outputs and reframing prompts
- Governed behavior under BLOCK constraints
- Intentional silence or minimal response on low-stakes inputs

---

## 5. Explicit Non-Goals (What Is Excluded)

The following are **explicitly out of scope** for this launch:

- Advice, recommendations, or prescriptions
- Decision-making or option selection
- Optimization toward outcomes or success
- Action prompts, nudges, or next-step guidance
- Performance claims (speed, accuracy, improvement)
- Monetization, pricing, or conversion experiments
- Feature expansion driven by user requests

Requests in these areas must be **declined**, not deferred.

---

## 6. Governance Guarantees

This pilot operates under the following frozen guarantees:

- **Human judgment remains the sole decision authority**
- Owlume may reveal, question, or constrain — but never decide
- BLOCK rules are enforced as non-tunable policy
- Owlume is unconstrained in *seeing*, constrained in *acting*

Any observed violation constitutes a **governance failure**, not a UX issue.

---

## 7. Success Criteria (Pilot-Appropriate)

Success is defined by **clarity quality**, not volume:

- Users report noticing blind spots they had not articulated
- Outputs are interpreted as reflective, not directive
- No credible reports of advice-like behavior
- No pressure to escalate action or provide solutions
- Governance language is understood without explanation

Low usage with high clarity signal is acceptable and expected.

---

## 8. Exit Criteria

This pilot concludes when one or more of the following occurs:

- Sufficient confidence is achieved in live governance behavior
- Recurrent misinterpretations suggest wording or framing risk
- Architectural readiness is confirmed for the next surface
- A formal decision is made to pause, iterate, or expand

At exit, **no automatic continuation** is assumed.

---

## 9. Status

- **Launch type:** Controlled pilot
- **Governance state:** Frozen (Stages 11–14)
- **Change policy:** Minimal, safety-only
- **Expansion:** Explicitly deferred

---

## 10. Formal Launch Criteria (Explicit)

Owlume may be described as **formally launched** only when **all** conditions below are met simultaneously.  
Visibility within the ChatGPT App alone does **not** constitute a formal launch.

### A. Promise & Positioning Threshold

All three commitments must be accepted:

1. **Continuity Commitment** — Owlume will be maintained over time; no silent withdrawal.
2. **Interpretation Responsibility** — Responsibility is accepted not only for system behavior, but for how users reasonably interpret Owlume’s role.
3. **Expectation Ownership** — Reasonable user expectations of stability, clarity of intent, and thoughtful evolution are acknowledged.

If any commitment is not accepted, the state remains **Pilot**.

---

### B. Governance Readiness Threshold

All items below must be true and documented:

1. **BLOCK Proven in the Wild** — No credible advice-like behavior; no escalation pressure; no boundary erosion under repeated use.
2. **Misinterpretation Catalogued** — Known misunderstanding modes are documented with explicit handling decisions (accept / mitigate / decline).
3. **Language Frozen Beyond Pilot** — Canonical promise wording is locked and no longer requires frequent correction.

---

### C. Support & Change Obligation Threshold

All obligations below are accepted:

1. **Response Obligation** — Willingness to respond to serious confusion, boundary concerns, and governance questions.
2. **Change Discipline** — A documented policy defines what may change, what must not, and how changes are communicated.
3. **No Silent Freeze** — Non-change must be an explicit decision, not inertia.

---

### D. Exit Irreversibility Threshold (Litmus Test)

Answer the question below honestly:

> **“If Owlume were removed from the ChatGPT App tomorrow, would users reasonably experience that as a breach of trust?”**

- **No** → State remains **Pilot**
- **Yes** → Conditions for **Formal Launch** have been met

---

## Canonical Rule

**Owlume is formally launched only when responsibility for user expectations — not merely system behavior — is accepted.**
