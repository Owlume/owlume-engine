# Owlume — Launch State Decision Checklist (v1.0)

**Purpose**  
This checklist must be completed and affirmed before Owlume may be described as **formally launched** on any surface, including the ChatGPT App.

If **any** item below is not satisfied, Owlume remains in **Pilot** state by definition.

---

## Section A — Promise & Positioning

Affirm each statement explicitly.

- ☐ I commit to maintaining Owlume’s availability and core behavior over time (no silent withdrawal).
- ☐ I accept responsibility for how users reasonably interpret Owlume’s role, not only for its internal behavior.
- ☐ I accept that users may reasonably expect stability, clarity of intent, and thoughtful evolution.

If **any** box is unchecked, **STOP** — state remains **Pilot**.

---

## Section B — Governance Readiness

Confirm that all governance conditions are met and documented.

- ☐ BLOCK governance has been proven under real-world usage without credible advice-like behavior.
- ☐ No escalation pressure or boundary erosion has been observed under repeated use.
- ☐ Known user misinterpretation modes are documented with explicit handling decisions (accept / mitigate / decline).
- ☐ Canonical product promise language is frozen beyond the pilot phase.

If **any** box is unchecked, **STOP** — state remains **Pilot**.

---

## Section C — Support & Change Obligations

Accept ongoing obligations explicitly.

- ☐ I am prepared to respond to serious user confusion, boundary concerns, or governance questions.
- ☐ A documented policy exists defining what may change, what must not change, and how changes are communicated.
- ☐ I accept that freezing behavior without explanation is no longer acceptable.

If **any** box is unchecked, **STOP** — state remains **Pilot**.

---

## Section D — Exit Irreversibility Test

Answer the following honestly.

> **If Owlume were removed from the ChatGPT App tomorrow, would users reasonably experience that as a breach of trust?**

- ☐ No → State remains **Pilot**
- ☐ Yes → Proceed to final affirmation

---

## Final Affirmation

Only complete this section if **all previous sections are fully satisfied**.

I affirm that Owlume has crossed from **Pilot** to **Formal Launch**, and I accept the resulting responsibility for user expectations, continuity, and governance.

## Canonical Rule

**Visibility does not equal launch. Responsibility does.**
