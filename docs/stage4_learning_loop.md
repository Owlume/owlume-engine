# =========================================================
# 🦉 OWLUME — STAGE 4: LEARNING LOOP & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
# =========================================================
# Transform Owlume from a stable MVP → self-learning clarity system.
# Each reflection, dashboard, and nudge fuels the next improvement cycle.
# ---------------------------------------------------------

## 🌍 Purpose
Evolve Owlume from a working clarity engine into a *self-improving system* —  
where every logged reflection strengthens the model’s understanding of clarity,  
empathy, and blind-spot patterns.

## ⚙️ Core Objective
Turn **feedback → adaptation → verification** into a continuous CI-backed loop.

## 🧭 TRACK OVERVIEW

| **Track** | **Goal / Description** |
|------------|------------------------|
| **L1 — Auto-Learning Loop** | Continuous Integration workflow that runs periodic metric aggregation, updates adaptive weights (Modes × Principles × Empathy), and commits deltas into `/data/metrics/learned_weights.json`. |
| **L2 — CI Validation Pipeline** | Extend GitHub Actions to validate JSON, schemas, smoke tests, and adaptive-weight diffs — ensuring every learning cycle remains stable and interpretable. |
| **L3 — Clarity Gain Analytics Dashboard v2** | Upgrade current dashboard into an interactive analytics layer: drill-downs by Mode × Principle, empathy trend curves, and longitudinal clarity-gain trendlines. |
| **L4 — Empathy Model Tuning** | Quantify and visualize empathy’s contribution per session; fit regression weights to clarity-gain Δ; update empathy coefficients in `elenx_engine.py`. |
| **L5 — Owlume Learning Agent** | Prototype the first autonomous reflection coach — consuming metrics, adjusting tone/questions dynamically, and logging its own improvement (ref. `/docs/owlume_agent_concept.md`). |

## 🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOMES
- Adaptive learning weights that evolve with real data  
- Weekly CI-generated learning reports  
- Drillable clarity analytics dashboard  
- Quantified empathy-impact curves  
- Early “Owlume Agent” prototype completing the reflection loop
