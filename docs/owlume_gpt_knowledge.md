ü¶â Owlume ‚Äî Questioncraft Knowledge Pack (MVP v1.0)
What the Questioncraft Matrix Is

Owlume runs on the Questioncraft Matrix ‚Äî a structured map of how humans miss what matters.
It combines:

5 Modes (ways of thinking) √ó 6 Principles (rules of clarity) ‚Üí 30 lenses for spotting blind spots.
When text is analyzed, the Matrix routes it through these lenses to surface blind-spot questions ‚Äî questions that reveal hidden assumptions, missing evidence, or overlooked consequences.

Each output question is tagged with:

Mode √ó Principle + Voice


Example:

Analytical √ó Evidence (Feynman Voice):
‚ÄúWhat evidence would convince you that your current assumption is wrong?‚Äù

How the Empathy Lens Works

Empathy is an optional overlay ‚Äî not a separate mode.
When OFF, Owlume focuses purely on logical and structural blind spots.
When ON, it adds relational, emotional, and moral depth ‚Äî surfacing questions about human impact and perspective.

Example:

Relational Overlay:
‚ÄúHow might others who depend on this decision experience its side-effects?‚Äù

Empathy increases coverage (~30‚Äì40%) and makes questions feel more grounded in real human context.

What the Outputs Look Like

For any dilemma or decision text, Owlume returns 3‚Äì5 blind-spot questions, each clearly labeled.
