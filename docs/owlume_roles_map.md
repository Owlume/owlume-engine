   🦉  OWLUME — ROLES MAP (STAGE 3–4)
   Who Leads What — From Build to Adaptive Learning
───────────────────────────────────────────────

| 🧾 **Project Status** | **Details** |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Version** | v1.0 — Execution Blueprint |
| **Stage** | Stage 3 → Stage 4 (Build → Adaptive Learning) |
| **Purpose** | Clarify leadership and responsibility across founder, AI partner, and developer |
| **Status** | ✅ Defined • 🧩 Implementation Coordination Pending |
| **Last Updated** | October 2025 |

---

## 🧩 1. Overview

Owlume operates best when **each role amplifies the others**:

- **Brian** — *Architect of Clarity* (vision, philosophy, product decisions)  
- **Ted** — *System Intelligence* (architecture, logic, documentation, iteration guidance)  
- **Developer** — *Technical Executor* (implementation, deployment, reliability)

## ⚙️ 2. Roles by Phase

| Phase | Brian (Founder) | Ted (AI Partner) | Developer |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Stage 3 — T1: Elenx Engine Integration** | Approves logic fit & tone | Defines detectMode/Principle flow & JSON mapping | Implements engine modules, connects to schema |
| **Stage 3 — T2: DilemmaNet Logging** | Defines clarity metrics & privacy rules | Specifies data schema & validation | Builds logging pipeline, tests CG capture |
| **Stage 3 — T3: UX / App Store Integration** | Oversees brand tone & user ritual | Ensures empathy toggle + logic linkage | Configures GPT behavior, tests flows |
| **Stage 3 — T4: Learning Dashboard** | Interprets clarity trends & decides pivots | Defines metric aggregation logic | Implements dashboard, connects data source |
| **Stage 4 — Adaptive Learning** | Sets learning goals & success measures | Monitors DilemmaNet feedback loops | Automates tuning (CDE), manages releases |
| **Stage 4 — System Scale-Up** | Guides product direction, QA insight | Generates new logic versions (v1.1 → v2.0) | Optimizes code, handles API scaling |

## 🧠 3. Collaboration Pattern

Brian → defines purpose & test of clarity
↳ Ted → designs and documents reasoning logic
↳ Developer → implements, tests, deploys
↳ Ted → monitors outputs, refines logic
↳ Brian → interprets learning data → product strategy


Each cycle = one full **Clarity Loop** — philosophy → system → data → adaptation → insight.

---

## 🔩 4. Guiding Principles

| Principle | Meaning in Practice |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Clarity First** | Decisions favor interpretability over speed. |
| **Structured Doubt** | Question assumptions at every build checkpoint. |
| **Empathy Always** | Design for trust and understanding, not just logic. |
| **Measurable Learning** | Every feature should show a Clarity Gain delta. |

## 🧭 5. When to Involve Each Role

| Scenario | Lead | Support |
|-----------|------|---------|
| New dataset or schema update | Ted | Developer |
| Logic refactor or question model change | Ted | Brian |
| User feedback loop tuning | Brian | Ted |
| Deployment / debugging | Developer | Ted |
| Performance optimization | Developer | Ted |
| New learning metric proposal | Brian | Ted |
| Scaling decision | Brian | Developer |

---

## 💬 6. Communication Cadence

| Frequency | Channel | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Weekly | Build sync (Brian + Dev + Ted) | Review progress, clarify blockers |
| Fortnightly | Reflection review | Evaluate clarity trends (CDE loop) |
| Monthly | Strategy sync | Adjust direction, define next milestone |
