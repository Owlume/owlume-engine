# 🧩 T1 — Elenx Engine Integration (Completion Summary)

**Stage:** 3 — Execution Phase: *Build It for Real*  
**Date:** 2025-10-18  
**Owner:** Brian Shen  
**System:** Owlume (Elenx Engine + Questioncraft Matrix)

---

## 🎯 Objective
Connect the Questioncraft Matrix, Voices layer, and context/fallacy priors into a working Elenx engine capable of detecting blind-spot questions dynamically across all five cognitive Modes.

---

## ⚙️ Steps Completed

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **1. Loader Integration** | All JSON packs (Matrix, Voices, Fallacies, Context Drivers) validated and loaded via `elenx_loader.py`. | ✅ |
| **2. Engine Shim** | Built lightweight `ElenxEngine` core with `_detect_mode_principle()` and `analyze()` methods. | ✅ |
| **3. Hybrid Fusion** | Integrated semantic + prior cues with confidence-gated blending and empathy trigger. | ✅ |
| **4. Thresholds & Top-2 Logic** | Added adaptive confidence thresholds and ALT Mode/Principle carry-forward. | ✅ |
| **5. Matrix + Voices Integration** | Implemented voice overlays (Thiel, Peterson, Feynman) with schema-validated `voices.json`. | ✅ |
| **6. Full Matrix Coverage & Mode Diversification** | Added linguistic cue scoring for Creative / Reflective / Growth; re-ordered top principles for all Modes. | ✅ |

## 🧭 Final Matrix Alignment (Lead Principles)

| Mode | Lead Principle | Intent |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Analytical** | Evidence & Validation | Start from what’s provable and measurable. |
| **Critical** | Assumption | Expose flawed or biased premises. |
| **Creative** | Exploration *(synthetic)* | Generate new possibilities and reframes. |
| **Reflective** | Root Cause | Extract lessons from recurring patterns. |
| **Growth** | Iteration | Adapt through small, compounding improvements. |

> These first principles now serve as default anchors for each Mode when no specific cue fires, ensuring interpretability and coverage across all five cognitive dimensions.

## 🧪 Validation Results (Hybrid Fusion Smoke Test)

All six test samples passed with correct Mode × Principle mappings:

MODE×PRINCIPLE: Analytical × Evidence & Validation
MODE×PRINCIPLE: Critical × Assumption
MODE×PRINCIPLE: Creative × Exploration
MODE×PRINCIPLE: Reflective × Root Cause
MODE×PRINCIPLE: Growth × Iteration


Priors and empathy activation confirmed functional:
- Stakeholder / incentive cues → Critical + empathy overlay.
- Reflective and Growth cues → proper introspective and adaptive questions.
- All Voices (Thiel, Peterson, Feynman) produced aligned overlays.

## 🧩 Key Files Affected

/src/elenx_engine.py
/src/elenx_loader.py
/data/matrix.json
/data/voices.json
/scripts/smoke_test_engine_fusion.py


---

## 🧠 Outcome
Elenx now operates as a **fully functional cognitive engine** with:
- 5 active Modes × 6 core Principles (+ 2 synthetic: Exploration, Iteration)
- Voice overlays and empathy routing
- Schema-validated data integration
- End-to-end reflection output pipeline

This marks the official **completion of Track T1** and transitions Owlume to:
→ **T2 — DilemmaNet Logging & Clarity Gain** *(complete)*  
→ **T3 — UX & App Store Integration** *(next active focus)*

---

**Status:** ✅ *T1 complete — Elenx Engine fully operational*
