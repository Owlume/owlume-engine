# 🟣 Owlume Ecosystem Map — v1  
**Stage:** 7 · S7-S1 — Ecosystem Map & Bridge Design  
**Date:** 2025-11-03  

---

## 🌐 Purpose  
Define how Owlume connects outward without losing its structural integrity or clarity promise.  
The ecosystem map frames all possible interfaces — from personal reflections to partner platforms.

---

## 🧭 Layer Map  

| Layer | Description | Example Interfaces |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Core** | Internal reasoning loop (Elenx + DilemmaNet + BSE + Empathy Lens) | Reflection sessions, Clarity Cards, Dashboard |
| **Near** | Trusted runtime surfaces | GPT App Loop Bridge · HR Pilot Bridge · Slack Reflection Bot |
| **Far** | External ecosystems or partner APIs | HR Analytics Suite · Leadership Coaching Apps · Learning Platforms |

---

## 🔗 Initial Bridge Candidates  

1. **GPT App Loop Bridge**  
   - Feeds Clarity Gain + BSE insights back into user reflections.  
   - Objective: strengthen personal reasoning continuity.  

2. **HR Pilot Bridge**  
   - Aggregates BSE vectors across individuals for talent clarity metrics.  
   - Objective: discover reasoning patterns that predict clarity potential.  

---

## 🔒 Clarity Exchange Principle  

> “Only clarity moves — never identity.”  
All exchanges use minimal JSON signals: mode, principle, cg_delta, bse_vector, timestamp.  
No text, name, or raw reflection content leaves the Core.

---

## 📦 Outputs  

- `/data/contracts/bridge_stub_v1.json` — contract for clarity exchange.  
- Bridge Readiness Checklist (template) — permissions · telemetry · reciprocity route.  

---

## 🧠 Next Step  
Refine mapping of **clarity flows** (Core ↔ Near ↔ Far) in diagram form and tag each with:
- direction (in/out)  
- data type (e.g., clarity signal, telemetry, bias vector)  
- trust level (open, trusted, private)
