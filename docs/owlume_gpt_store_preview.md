### **🦉 Owlume — Illuminate Blind Spots**

**Short description:**  
Most AI gives answers. Owlume reveals what you’re missing — because what you miss costs you.

**How it works:**  
Paste any text — a dilemma, plan, or decision — and Owlume will illuminate hidden assumptions, evidence gaps, and unseen drivers through 3–7 sharp, human-sounding questions.

**Example use cases:**  
- Test your team’s strategic decisions before meetings  
- Clarify trade-offs in product, pricing, or hiring decisions  
- Spot hidden assumptions in personal or leadership dilemmas  
- Turn vague plans into actionable clarity

**Why it’s different:**  
Owlume doesn’t give advice — it reveals blind spots.  
Powered by the **Questioncraft Matrix**, **Elenx Engine**, and **Empathy Lens**, it blends cognitive precision with human tone.
