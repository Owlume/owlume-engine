🦉 Owlume — Way Forward Map
From Rituals → Differentiation → Adaptive Learning

(The strategic roadmap for Stage 3 & beyond)

🌅 North Star

Make “checking blind spots” a daily ritual — and prove it delivers measurable Clarity Gain.

Owlume’s next horizon is not more features, but reinforcement: habitual use, measurable differentiation, and a self-learning engine.

🧩 1. Ritual Layer — Building Daily Frequency
Function	Description	Metric	Target
Gentle Daily Nudge	A light, reflective prompt each morning (“What decision feels unclear today?”)	Nudge Accept Rate (NAR)	≥ 25 %
Moment-Based Trigger	Timed to real contexts (before meetings, after choices)	Decision Check Rate (DCR)	≥ 1.5 sessions / user / week
Adaptive Timing	Learns ideal delivery windows per user	Time-to-Question (TTQ)	< 10 s
Outcome	Reflection becomes a micro-habit, producing Weekly Reflecting Users (WRU) — Owlume’s “DAU” for depth.		
💎 2. Differentiation Layer — Proving the Value of Clarity
Mechanism	What It Does	KPI / Proof
Golden Set Challenge v2	Benchmarks Owlume vs. generic AI on 20–30 dilemmas.	≥ 85 % responses rated “clearer”
Clarity Gain Metric	Quantifies clarity delta (CG_post − CG_pre).	Avg CG ≥ +0.4 Δ
Proof-of-Clarity Feedback	Translates metrics into motivational signals (Depth, Rarity, Empathy, Consistency).	1 reinforcing signal / session
Empathy Overlay Impact	Measures trust & adoption lift when empathy auto-triggers.	+20–30 % trust gain
Outcome	Owlume becomes measurably sharper and more human than any generic “blind-spot” prompt.	
⚙️ 3. Adaptive Layer — Clarity-Driven Engineering (CDE)
CDE Principle	Owlume Implementation	Purpose
Instrument Everything	Every reflection logs CG_pre/post, Mode×Principle, empathy state.	Traceable learning
Short Feedback Half-Life	New data weighted 10× higher.	Fast adaptation
Builder Visibility	DilemmaNet dashboard surfaces clarity trends & diagnostic lag.	Transparent tuning
Adaptive Release	Weekly model updates based on Clarity Gain, not usage counts.	Precision over volume
Outcome	The engine continuously self-calibrates toward sharper questioning & higher CG.

  Higher Clarity Gain → Sharper Questions → Stronger Ritual Loop

🚀 5. Next Milestones
Phase	Focus	Proof Metric
Stage 3 — Execution	Launch MVP on ChatGPT Store	Golden Set 85 % clarity win
Stage 3.5 — Adaptive Build	Fuse semantic + fallacy/context signals	Stable CG > 0.4 Δ
Stage 4 — Ritual Expansion	Introduce nudges & moment triggers	≥ 1.5 sessions / user / week
Stage 5 — Dataset & API	Launch DilemmaNet v1.0 for partners	Proven clarity learning loop
🪶 Summary Insight

Rituals create engagement → Differentiation proves trust → Adaptive learning compounds clarity.
Together, these three layers form Owlume’s enduring competitive moat — measured, meaningful, and human.

## ✅ T3-S3 — Share Object Verification (Completed)

**Commit:** `1cf2960`  
**Tag:** `T3-S3-share-object`  
**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Owner:** Brian Shen  

### Summary
- Added `share` object to `clarity_gain_record.schema.json` (privacy-first opt-in design)
- Created `validate_clarity_gain_record.py` schema validator
- Updated `demo_render_cards.py` to show `_Shared via …_` footer when `share.status == "opt_in"`
- Added sample record in `data/logs/clarity_gain_samples.jsonl`
- Added VS Code task: **Run → Validate Clarity Gain Record**
- All validations and demo outputs passed ✓

### Result
T3-S3 closes the **Share Object Verification** loop — Elenx now logs share actions cleanly with explicit consent and displays them correctly in rendered cards.

🦉 *Next milestone: T3-S4 – UX polish & share-card integration pipeline.*
