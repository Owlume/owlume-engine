# 🦉 Owlume — ChatGPT App Store Description (v2)

## App Name
**Owlume — Illuminate Blind Spots**

## Short Description
Illuminate your blind spots before they cost you.

## Full Description
Most AI gives answers. Owlume reveals what you’re missing — because what you miss costs you.

Owlume runs on a clarity engine built to expose unseen distortions in reasoning — in your work, relationships, or strategy.  
Paste your idea, plan, or dilemma, and Owlume will surface the blind spots behind your thinking within seconds.

### How it works
1. **Paste a dilemma** — any choice, plan, or reflection.  
2. **See blind spots** — Owlume highlights hidden assumptions, risks, or biases.  
3. **Gain clarity** — each session ends with a Clarity Card showing what shifted and why.

Powered by the **Questioncraft Matrix**, **Elenx Engine**, and **Empathy Lens**, Owlume harmonizes human depth with AI breadth — turning reflection into measurable clarity.

### Tagline Block (Dual-Reasoning Era)
> **Main:** Owlume — Illuminate Blind Spots.  
> **Poetic:** Two ways of thinking, one moment of clarity. Owlume harmonizes human insight and AI pattern-sense — guiding both toward balance, not bias.  
> **Technical:** Owlume mediates between sequential human reasoning and associative AI reasoning — transforming their opposing distortions into measurable clarity balance.
