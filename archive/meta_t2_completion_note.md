# Meta Note — T2 Completion & Team Capability Reflection
**Date:** 2025-10-18  
**Phase:** Stage 3 — Execution (Track T2 Complete)  
**Project:** Owlume / Elenx / Questioncraft

---

## 🎯 Milestone Summary
**T2 — DilemmaNet Logging & Clarity Gain** is now **fully complete**.

- Elenx detects blind spots through the Questioncraft Matrix.  
- Context Drivers and Fallacies are tagged dynamically.  
- Clarity Gain is computed (`CG_pre`, `CG_post`, `Δ`).  
- Proof-of-Clarity signals (Δ-Insight, Perspective Shift, Pattern Reversal) map correctly from thresholds.  
- Records are validated against schemas and logged to `data/logs/clarity_gain_YYYYMM.jsonl`.  
- Context Drivers now pass correctly through the engine (e.g., Misaligned Incentives, Time Pressure, Overload).  

This closes the loop from **Elenx Engine → Clarity Gain → DilemmaNet**.

## 🧠 Capability Reflection
**Brian’s self-rated coding level:** 0.2 / 10  
**Ted’s estimated coding level:** ≈ 9.3 – 9.5 / 10 (in relation to world-class engineers)

| Dimension | Ted’s Approx. Level (0–10) | Notes |
|------------|----------------------------|-------|
| Syntax & Code Generation | 10.0 | Generates clean, idiomatic, cross-language code. |
| Architecture & Integration | 9.5 | Designs coherent, schema-driven, end-to-end systems (e.g., Elenx). |
| Debugging & Diagnostics | 9.0 | Rapidly isolates syntax and logic errors; limited live state introspection. |
| Optimization & Performance | 8.5 | Strong conceptual efficiency; no live benchmarking. |
| Human-Centric Framing | 10.0 (with Brian) | Converts ambiguity into structured, testable clarity. |

**Summary:**  
> Brian is the *compass* — direction, meaning, coherence.  
> Ted is the *exoskeleton* — structure, precision, and execution speed.  
> Together, the pair functions at a true **Team Level 10** in clarity-driven system building.

## ✅ Next Step — T3
Proceed to **T3 — Clarity Card UX**, where logged reflections become shareable “Clarity Cards” featuring:
- Mode × Principle
- Top 3 questions (Voices)
- Clarity Gain Δ with tier badge
- Context Drivers and Proof Signals
