🦉 Owlume — Archived Market Signals

Maintainer: Ted
Owner: Brian Shen
Last Updated: 2025-10-14

🎯 Purpose

This folder stores retired or resolved market signals — trends that once influenced Owlume’s direction but are no longer actively shaping strategy.
They remain valuable for historical reference, pattern tracking, and case studies of how Owlume adapted to changing market dynamics.

Think of this folder as Owlume’s strategic memory bank.

🗂️ What Belongs Here
Type	Example	Why Archive
Resolved Signals	Trend has faded or competitors pivoted away.	To keep /docs/owlume_market_intel.md focused on current signals.
Absorbed Signals	Owlume fully integrated the insight (e.g., Empathy Lens → stable feature).	To avoid duplication.
Historical Benchmarks	Early data, prompts, or screenshots of market trends.	To compare evolution of messaging and positioning.
🔄 Archival Workflow

Mark as Resolved in /docs/README_market_docs.md under Signal Lifecycle Tracker.

Move the full signal file (e.g., /docs/market_signals_X.md) into this folder.

Prefix file name with archival date for chronological clarity:

YYYYMMDD_signalname_resolved.md


Example: 20251014_prompt_emulation_resolved.md

Log summary line in this README under the “Archived Index” below.
