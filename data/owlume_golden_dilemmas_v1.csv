GD01,"My co‑founder has been quieter in meetings and shipping fewer PRs. I’m thinking of quietly reallocating ownership to protect the company. If I bring it up, I fear damaging trust.",Interpersonal,Assumptions
GD02,"Our early adopters love the power‑user shortcuts, but activation for new users is terrible. I want to add an onboarding wizard, yet it could bloat the product. What’s the right first move?",Operational,Trade‑offs/Risks
GD03,A big enterprise logo wants a custom SSO feature in exchange for a one‑year contract. Building it would consume our small team for two sprints. Is this worth it?,Strategic,Opportunity Cost
GD04,"Churn is 7% monthly, but NPS is 54 and Twitter praise looks great. The team insists churn is just seasonal. I think something deeper is off.",Analytical,Evidence/Gaps
GD05,I’m preparing to raise a seed round and investors keep asking for a clear wedge. We can pitch either 'compliance AI' or 'workflow assistant'. Which story creates unfair advantage?,Strategic,Positioning/Differentiation
GD06,We’re debating usage‑based vs seat‑based pricing. Finance prefers predictability; customers say they want to 'start small'. I’m worried our price meter will distort behavior.,Analytical,Incentives/Behavior
GD07,A senior engineer pushes to rewrite the core service in Rust for performance. Our roadmap is already slipping. Could a partial refactor be smarter?,Operational,Scope/Alternatives
GD08,"A design partner keeps giving glowing feedback, but they get it for free. I’m not sure they represent a paying segment. Should we start charging them now?",Analytical,Sampling/Bias
GD09,Marketing proposes a bold rebrand before launch to 'feel premium'. It will delay GA by three weeks. Does signaling outweigh speed to market?,Strategic,Timing/Second‑Order
GD10,"Customer success escalations are piling up on one PM. She’s great but burning out. If I redistribute accounts, I could lose continuity for key logos.",Interpersonal,Capacity/Boundaries
GD11,We’re planning an Australia‑only launch to stay focused. A US influencer just offered a shout‑out that could spike American signups. Do we hold the line or ride the wave?,Strategic,Focus/Scope Creep
GD12,Security flagged our session logging as overly verbose. Product analytics rely on it. I’m torn between tightening data and keeping insight velocity.,Operational,Risk/Compliance
GD13,A candidate dazzled in the take‑home but dodged collaborative exercises. The hiring manager insists they’re '10x'. Am I overweighting likeability or underweighting team fit?,Interpersonal,Criteria/Signals
GD14,A competitor just open‑sourced a similar library. Our devs want to integrate it to move faster. Would that erode our IP or free us to focus on the proprietary layer?,Strategic,Build‑vs‑Buy
GD15,We’ve promised 'privacy‑first' to users. Growth wants referral tracking with deep attribution. How do we keep trust while learning what works?,Analytical,Constraints/Principles
GD16,Sales keeps promising features that don’t exist yet. They argue we need momentum. I worry we’re training customers to expect vapor.,Operational,Expectation/Risk
GD17,Two advisors recommend opposite things: 'go enterprise now' vs 'nail prosumers first'. Both have great track records. How do I avoid borrowing their biases?,Analytical,Authority/Appeals
GD18,"Our stand‑ups have ballooned to 40 minutes and feel performative. If I cut them to async updates, will collaboration suffer or improve?",Operational,Process/Change Impact
GD19,"A pilot user reported our AI suggestion sounded judgmental in sensitive contexts. We can add an empathy layer, but it may reduce crispness. What’s the right tone bar?",Interpersonal,User Trust/Experience
GD20,We’re considering a freemium tier to seed distribution. Support cost and spam risks worry me. Do we gate with waitlists or usage caps?,Strategic,Guardrails/Design
