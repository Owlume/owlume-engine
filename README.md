# ðŸ¦‰ Owlume â€” Illuminate Blind Spots

**Brand promise:** Illuminate your blind spots before they cost you.  
**Contrast line:** Most AI gives answers. Owlume reveals what youâ€™re missing â€” because what you miss costs you.  
**Challenge:** Now, let Owlume show you the blind spots behind your choices in seconds â€” before they cost you.

## Overview

Owlume is a clarity system built to detect cognitive and contextual blind spots in decisions. It fuses the **Questioncraft Matrix**, **Elenx Engine**, **Empathy Lens**, and **DilemmaNet** dataset into one adaptive architecture.

---

## Core Components

### 1. Questioncraft Matrix
A 5-Mode Ã— 6-Principle structure guiding how Owlume asks questions that reveal assumptions, evidence gaps, and distortions.  
â†’ `/data/matrix.json` and `/schemas/matrix.schema.json`

### 2. Elenx Engine
Routes user text through the Matrix, detects Mode Ã— Principle, overlays voices (e.g., Thiel, Feynman, Peterson), and applies empathy modulation.  
â†’ `/docs/elenx_architecture.md`

### 3. DilemmaNet Dataset
The structured data spine logging dilemmas, blind-spot tags, clarity metrics, and feedback.  
â†’ `/docs/dilemmanet_overview.md`

### 4. Empathy Lens
Cross-cutting overlay that expands blind-spot coverage into relational and moral domains, improving adoption and trust.  
â†’ `/docs/empathy_lens.md`

## Development Philosophy

**Clarity-Driven Engineering (CDE)** â€” Owlumeâ€™s variant of Feedback-Driven Engineering (FDE).  
Instead of measuring clicks or time, Owlume measures **clarity gained per reflection**. Every interaction becomes a feedback event that improves both the engine and the dataset.

**North Star Metric:** Clarity Gain (CGÎ”) â€” the measurable increase in user understanding between entering and leaving a reflection.

* **/schemas/** â†’ JSON Schema definitions (draft-07) for VS Code validation.

## DilemmaNet & Clarity Gain Logging

Owlume measures clarity before and after each reflection and logs a structured record into DilemmaNet. This turns every session into learning that sharpens Elenx.

**What we log (per reflection):**
- DID (Dilemma ID), CID (Conversation ID), optional QIDs (Mode Ã— Principle tags)
- Clarity scores: `CG_pre`, `CG_post`, and `CG_delta = CG_post âˆ’ CG_pre`
- Timestamp, app version, empathy overlay flag, and anonymous runtime signals

**Clarity thresholds:**
- Micro: Î” 1â€“2 â€” minor shift  
- **Meaningful:** Î” â‰¥ 3 â€” noticeable change (MVP success minimum)  
- Major: Î” â‰¥ 6 â€” transformative insight

**Files:**
- `/data/clarity_gain_thresholds.json` â€” reference thresholds & labels
- `/data/proof_of_clarity_signals.json` â€” user-facing feedback texts by delta range
- `/data/proof_of_clarity_insight_signals.json` â€” optional badges (rarity, depth, empathy, consistency)
- `/schemas/clarity_gain_record.schema.json` â€” validation for per-session records

**Privacy by default:**
- No raw text stored by default; records use hashed IDs
- Shareable summaries are opt-in and follow redaction rules (`share` object in schema)
- Users can view or delete their data summary on request

**Why it matters:**  
Clarity Gain is Owlumeâ€™s quality signal. Higher Î” correlates with sharper questions, better decisions, and a smarter engine over time.

## Stage 3 Documents

### [Clarity-Driven Engineering](/docs/clarity_driven_engineering.md)
Defines Owlumeâ€™s evolution of Feedback-Driven Engineering (FDE).  
Explains how every reflection becomes a data event, measured by clarity gained per interaction (CGÎ”).

### [Clarity Gain Metric](/docs/clarity_gain_metric.md)
Specifies the core KPI of Owlumeâ€™s adaptive system â€” Clarity Gain (CG).  
Describes how clarity_before â†’ clarity_after deltas are computed, weighted, and logged to DilemmaNet.

### [Owlume GPT Monetization Blueprint](/docs/owlume_gpt_monetization_blueprint.md)
Outlines Owlumeâ€™s three-layer monetization model: GPT App, Elenx API, and DilemmaNet dataset.  
Shows how CDE turns cognitive feedback into recurring economic value.

### [Owlume Agent Concept](/docs/owlume_agent_concept.md)
Early design paper for the future autonomous Owlume Agent.  
Explores timing, architecture, and roles after 100â€“500 reflections are logged in DilemmaNet.
