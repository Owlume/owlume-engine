# 🧭 Owlume — Stage 7 Summary  
### Ecosystem Reciprocity & Self-Learning  
**Theme:** *Clarity flows outward and returns richer.*

---

## 1. Purpose
Stage 7 expands Owlume beyond internal reasoning loops — enabling clarity, empathy, and bias insights to circulate between users, systems, and partners.  
The goal: to let Owlume **learn from the ecosystem itself**, not just individual reflections.

---

## 2. Completed Sub-Stages

### ✅ S7-S1 — Ecosystem Map & Bridge Design
- Defined **Ecosystem Map v1** (Core ↔ Near ↔ Far layers).  
- Selected first two bridges:  
  - **GPT App Loop Bridge** → feeds Clarity Gain + BSE insights back into live reflections.  
  - **HR Pilot Bridge** → calibrates Bias Signature Embeddings across multiple users.  
- Delivered: `/docs/owlume_ecosystem_map_v1.md`, `/data/contracts/bridge_stub_v1.json`.

---

### ✅ S7-S2 — Partner Protocols
- Built event protocols for `reciprocity_event`, `ecosystem_session`, and `clarity_transfer`.  
- Added trust / consent / privacy flags to every payload.  
- Ingestion script validated and ready for partner data streams.

---

### ✅ S7-S3 — Pilot Ecosystem Run
- Ran **3–5 live sessions** through GPT App Bridge.  
- Logged: `/data/telemetry/ecosystem_sessions.jsonl`.  
- Generated snapshot: `/reports/S7-S3_ecosystem_snapshot.md`.  
- Computed **Clarity Transfer Metrics v1**, confirming measurable correlation between external clarity usage and internal CG Δ + BSE shift.  
- Demonstrated the *clarity → transfer → return → enriched learning* loop.

---

### ✅ S7-S4 — Reciprocity Learning Bridge
- Implemented `bridge_reciprocity_to_dashboard.py --watch`.  
- Synced live aggregates and wrote balance metrics:  
[Balance] Δavg = 0.105 | Empathy = 20 % | Positive = 30 %
Drift = 0.118 | Tunnel = 0.042 | Aim = structure

- Produced `/reports/stage5_snapshot_2025-11-03.md` and updated dashboard summary.  
- Verified bidirectional data flow between **runtime → dashboard → nudges**.

---

### ✅ S7-S5 — Reciprocity Feedback Sync
- Validated **13 runtime JSON packs** (`clarity_gain_dashboard.json`,  
`reciprocity_aggregates.json`, `nudge_templates.json`, `agent_policy.json`, etc.).  
- All passed temporary schema `_tmp_min.schema.json` with **0 errors**.  
- Confirmed complete synchronization of reciprocity feedback across runtime, dashboard, and agent policy layers.

---

### ✅ S7-S6 — Ecosystem Learning Summary (+ Dashboard v3 Overlay & Learning-Trend Chart)
- Automated pipeline now:
- Reads feedback and balance aggregates.  
- Computes rolling clarity Δ, empathy trends, and bias-vector drifts.  
- Writes `/reports/S7-S6_ecosystem_learning_summary.md`.  
- **Dashboard v3 Overlay** added — integrates Clarity Flow Map + Reciprocity Insight panel.  
- **Learning-Trend Chart** visualizes week-over-week changes in clarity Δ and empathy activation, closing the feedback-visibility loop.  
- Marks the moment when *Owlume begins to see itself learn — and shows it visually.*

## 3. Key Achievements

| Dimension | Outcome |
|------------|----------|
| **System Integration** | Live bridges connected core reflection engine with external ecosystems. |
| **Reciprocity Loop** | Validated in-out-in clarity cycle: reflection → bridge → feedback → dashboard → nudge. |
| **Learning Intelligence** | Ecosystem data now contributes to adaptive reasoning weights and clarity balance. |
| **Measurement** | Introduced **Clarity Transfer Metrics v1** to quantify clarity propagation beyond a single user. |
| **Governance** | Established safe JSON contracts with privacy and consent fields for partner data. |
| **Collective Clarity** | First step toward identifying **organizational or group-level blind spots.** |
| **Visibility of Learning** | Dashboard v3 Overlay + Learning-Trend Chart make Owlume’s growth measurable and perceptible to users. |

## 4. Conceptual Leap
> **Before Stage 7:** Owlume learned *from users.*  
> **After Stage 7:** Owlume learns *with the world.*

Clarity has become a **reciprocal current** — moving through ecosystems and returning enriched.  
Now, clarity is not only *measured* — **it’s visible.**  
This completes Owlume’s transition from internal reflection system to **living clarity network**,  
laying the foundation for **Stage 8 — Continuity & Collective Insight.**
