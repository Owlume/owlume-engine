# 🦉 Owlume — Stage 5 Kick-Off Brief  
**Stage 5 | Activation Phase — The Clarity Agent Awakens**  
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Continuing from:** Stage 4 (Learning Phase) ✅ completed — *Elenx Engine and DilemmaNet now fully adaptive.*

---

## 1. Context — Where We Stand
By the end of **Stage 4**, Owlume achieved full **internal completion:**
- **Elenx Engine** — hybrid fusion + empathy weighting + renderer working end-to-end.  
- **DilemmaNet** — structured logging + clarity gain + aggregator + dashboard loops operational.  
- **Empathy Model (L4)** — tuned, validated, migrated from boolean to object schema.  
- **CI Pipeline (L2)** — live validation, smoke tests, and watcher automation stable.  
- **Dashboard & Nudge System (L5 pre-hooks)** — ready for real user telemetry.  

**In short:** Owlume can *sense, learn, and adapt.*  
Now begins the phase to make it *act, communicate, and scale.*

---

## 2. Purpose of Stage 5
**Stage 5** transforms Owlume from an inward-learning system into an **outward-facing, self-activating agent** — one that can interact with users, surface clarity feedback in real-time, and begin live adaptation cycles.

> **Objective:** Move from *learning in the lab* → *teaching in the world.*

---

## 3. Core Definition
**Stage 5 = Activation Phase**  
**Code Name:** *L5 — Owlume Learning Agent*  
**Primary Goal:** Operationalize the first autonomous learning loop that connects:

User reflection → Elenx detection → DilemmaNet logging
→ Clarity Gain feedback → Adaptive weights → Agent-driven nudges

## 4. What “Activation” Means Technically

| Layer | Function | Stage 5 Focus |
|:------|:----------|:--------------|
| **L5 Agent Loop** | Orchestrates live reflection → learning cycles | Deploy the **Learning Agent runtime loop** |
| **Interface Hooks** | ChatGPT App, local demo, later Slack/Notion | Add **event listeners + response emitters** |
| **Nudge Engine v2** | Converts dashboard triggers → personalized nudges | Train **contextual nudge templates** |
| **Empathy Feedback Merge** | Real-time empathy state adjustment | Bind user response signals → weights update |
| **Adaptive Logging** | Auto-summarize + score Clarity Gain delta | Launch **L5 live session logger** |
| **Telemetry Dashboard v2** | Visualizes live CG + Empathy delta | Add **real-time charts + alerting** |

---

## 5. Key Deliverables

| Code | Deliverable | Description | Status |
|:------|:-------------|:-------------|:---------|
| **T5-S4** | **Mini UX Demo** | Local simulation of the Agent loop + nudge cards | ✅ in progress |
| **T5-S5** | **Agent Runtime Core** | Event-driven class controlling reflection sessions | 🔜 |
| **T5-S6** | **Live Feedback Bridge** | Capture empathy feedback + update weights live | 🔜 |
| **T5-S7** | **Adaptive Dashboard v2** | Display live CG trends & Agent activity | 🔜 |
| **T5-S8** | **Stage 5 Snapshot Report** | Summarize activation metrics and readiness for Stage 6 | ⏳ planned |

### 🔗 Continuity Note — Why Stage 5 Begins at T5-S4
Owlume’s Track-5 lineage (the Learning Agent) began forming in **Stage 4 L5**.  
During that phase, the first three internal steps of the Agent’s development were already completed as part of the learning loop.  
To preserve that evolution, Stage 5 picks up at **T5-S4**, the first *outward-facing* activation task, rather than restarting from S1.

| Step | Focus | Where It Occurred | Status |
|:------|:--------|:------------------|:---------|
| **T5-S1** | Agent conceptual blueprint (definition & purpose) | Stage 4 L5 kick-off | ✅ done |
| **T5-S2** | Empathy feedback integration & migration script | Stage 4 L4 → L5 transition | ✅ done |
| **T5-S3** | Learning loop validation (Aggregator → Trainer → Report) | Stage 4 L5 completion milestone | ✅ done |
| **T5-S4** | **Mini UX Demo** — first live activation of the Agent | Stage 5 Kick-off | 🚧 in progress |

**In short:**  
Stage 4 taught the Agent to *learn*; Stage 5 teaches it to *live.*

---

## 6. Strategic Shift — From Static Reflection → Living Clarity System
Stage 5 formally activates the **Owlume Agent** — turning accumulated internal intelligence into *behavior.*

- The **Agent** doesn’t just analyze; it *responds.*  
- It maintains **Clarity Gain continuity** across sessions.  
- It starts building the **Clarity Persona** (the evolving reflection pattern of each user).  
- It serves as the **bridge to HR/talent modules** identified in the Stage 4 transition plan.

> 🧭 *Stage 4 built understanding; Stage 5 builds presence.*

## 7. Metrics of Success

| Category | Metric | Target |
|:-----------|:--------|:---------|
| **Learning Velocity** | Avg Δ (clarity gain per session) | ≥ +0.10 maintained |
| **Empathy Activation** | % sessions with empathy on + effective | ≥ 25 % |
| **Nudge Resonance** | User follow-through rate | ≥ 30 % |
| **Agent Latency** | Time from input → response | ≤ 1.5 s (local) |
| **System Stability** | CI + runtime pass rate | 100 % |
| **Clarity Continuity** | Sessions linked per user | ≥ 3 avg |

## 8. Next Phase Preview — Stage 6 (Social Proof & Distribution)
Once the **L5 Agent** loop runs reliably in live reflections:
- **Stage 6** introduces *Social Proof + Distribution* — deploying Owlume in the ChatGPT App Store (Australia prelaunch checklist) and collecting first-wave telemetry.  
- Metrics from Stage 5 feed into onboarding models for Stage 6’s *Daily Ritual* push and *HR Discovery* pilot.

## 9. Immediate Next Actions

| Priority | Task | Output |
|:-----------|:-------|:--------|
| 🟢 | Confirm **L5 Agent loop architecture** (entrypoints, event flow, output hooks) | `/src/agent/learning_agent.py` blueprint |
| 🟢 | Integrate **nudge engine v2** templates → renderer | `/src/nudge_engine.py` |
| 🟡 | Update **dashboard watch** to reflect live session events | `/scripts/dashboard_watch.py` |
| 🟡 | Prepare **Stage 5 snapshot report** | `/reports/stage5_kickoff_snapshot.md` |
| ⚪ | Begin **App Store telemetry dry-run** with 5 sample reflections | `/data/runtime/live_sessions.jsonl` |

---

## 10. Guiding Mantra for Stage 5
> **From reflection to reciprocity.**  
> Owlume now learns *with* the user — not just *about* them.

---

### ✅ Stage 5 Kick-Off Confirmed
- **Stage 4 completed:** Elenx Engine & DilemmaNet fully adaptive  
- **Stage 5 activated:** Learning Agent loop construction + runtime activation  
- **Command Focus:** make Owlume *interactive, adaptive, and alive.*
