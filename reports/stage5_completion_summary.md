# 🦉 Owlume — Stage 5 Completion Summary  
**Date:** 2025-10-31 | **Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Phase:** Activation Phase – _The Clarity Agent Awakens_  
**Guiding Mantra:** “From reflection to reciprocity — Owlume now learns with the user, not just about them.”

---

## 1. Overview
Stage 5 transformed Owlume from a passive reflection engine into a **living clarity system** that reacts, learns, and records autonomously.  
Each runtime cycle now closes the full feedback loop:

Reflection → Insight → Aggregation → Dual-Reasoning Balance → Snapshot Report

## 2. Subsystem Status

| Track | Sub-Stage | Description | Result |
|-------|------------|--------------|---------|
| T5-S4 | Mini UX Demo | Interactive Clarity Cards and empathy-aware renderer | ✅ Working |
| T5-S5 | Runtime Integration | Elenx engine connected to DilemmaNet runtime | ✅ Operational |
| T5-S6 | Feedback Bridge | Watcher emits contextual nudges + runtime feedback | ✅ Stable |
| T5-S7 | Dashboard v2 Flow | Auto-refresh aggregates + live charts | ✅ Running |
| T5-S8 | Snapshot Report | Daily markdown summary + Dual-Reasoning balance | ✅ Complete |

## 4. Artifacts Generated
- `data/metrics/aggregates_balance_*.json` — 7-day Dual-Reasoning averages  
- `reports/stage5_snapshot_YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily snapshot reports  
- `reports/last_snapshot.log` — UTC timestamp of latest run  
- `scripts/dashboard_watch_runtime.py` — final Stage 5 watcher  
- `scripts/compute_balance_metrics.py` (UTC-aware)  
- `scripts/generate_snapshot_report.py` (Stage 5 version)

---

## 5. Key Advances
- **Dual-Reasoning Integration:** Depth × Breadth metrics with structural aim ( `structure / widen / neutral` )
- **Empathy Default:** On by configuration (`EMPATHY_DEFAULT_ON =True`)
- **Continuous Clarity Loop:** From user reflection to daily report with no manual steps
- **Timestamped State Management:** `watch_state.json` prevents duplicate processing
- **UTC Normalization:** All runtime metrics now timezone-aware

## 6. Next Stage Preview → Stage 6 : Continuity Phase
| Focus | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Adaptive Learning Agent | Transform the watcher into a persistent “Clarity Agent” capable of proactive learning from user patterns. |
| Live Dashboard v3 | Web-served dashboard rendering snapshots + balance trends in real time. |
| Narrative Analytics | Generate summary threads (“7 Days of Clarity”) for user review. |
