**Window:** Last 14 days • **EMA α = 0.25**

## Vitals
- Rolling Clarity Δ (EMA last): 0.000  • trend slope: +0.0000
- Rolling Empathy (EMA last):  0.000  • trend slope: +0.0000
- Reciprocity Return Ratio (>0): 0.0%
- Bias-Vector Drift (last→now, L2): 0.012

**Empathy spark:** `··················`

## What the System Is Learning
No reciprocity events were found in the last 14 days. Vitals are shown as 0.000 by design; this summary is a structural heartbeat, not a learning update.

## Suggested Actions
- If empathy trend is positive and return ratio ≥ 50%, reinforce **empathy-aligned** questions in high-yield bridges.
- If bias drift rises while clarity trends up, surface **Bias Insight Cards** to make learning visible without friction.
- If clarity stalls and empathy falls, emit **recovery nudges** focusing on Evidence × Perspective.

## Overlay Notes
This report feeds the Dashboard v3 overlay:
- **Clarity Flow Map:** update nodes/edges with EMA clarity and source mix.
- **Reciprocity Insight Panel:** show empathy slope and return ratio badges.
