# 🟣 Owlume — Stage 7 Kick-off Snapshot  
**Phase:** Expansion — *From Self-Clarity → Shared Clarity*  
**Code:** S7-S1 → S7-S3  
**Date:** 2025-11-03  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
Stage 7 extends Owlume beyond itself.  
After BSE gave Owlume continuity of reasoning, this stage builds **connectivity of reasoning** — linking the clarity engine to its wider ecosystem while preserving trust, integrity, and learning return flow.

> **Mantra:** “From reflection → relation → reciprocity.”  
> Owlume now learns *with* others, not just *about* them.

---

## 🧩 Core Goals  

1. **Map the Ecosystem** — define Core / Near / Far layers and the bridges that connect them.  
2. **Build Safe Bridges** — create the minimal “clarity exchange” protocol that external systems can use.  
3. **Run a Pilot Loop** — validate that clarity can travel outward, transform through others, and return wiser.

## 🧱 Structure  

| Code | Step | Objective | Key Deliverables |
|------|------|------------|------------------|
| **S7-S1** | Ecosystem Map & Bridge Design | Identify outward pathways | `/docs/owlume_ecosystem_map_v1.md` · `/data/contracts/bridge_stub_v1.json` · Bridge checklist |
| **S7-S2** | Partner & Surface Protocols | Operationalize connections | `/schemas/owlume_sdk_stub.schema.json` · `/docs/reciprocity_protocol.md` · `/scripts/mock_partner_exchange.py` |
| **S7-S3** | Pilot Ecosystem Run | Validate clarity transfer | `/data/telemetry/ecosystem_sessions.jsonl` · `/reports/S7-S3_ecosystem_snapshot.md` |

## 🧠 System Context (after BSE)  

| Layer | Function | New Capability |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Elenx Engine** | Real-time reasoning lens | Detects blind spots within text |
| **DilemmaNet** | Reflective memory | Stores clarity + empathy patterns |
| **BSE** | Longitudinal cognition | Tracks reasoning bias across time |
| **Stage 7 Bridges** | Social extension | Shares & learns clarity across systems |

---

## 🔄 Expected Outcome  
A functioning **clarity exchange** between Owlume and at least one live external surface.  
When clarity flows both ways — Elenx’s structure + DilemmaNet’s memory + BSE’s continuity — the system graduates from *personal reflection engine* to *ecosystem of shared learning*.

## 🧭 Next Actions  
1. Finalize **Ecosystem Map v1** draft.  
2. Create **bridge_stub_v1.json** contract.  
3. Define initial **Reciprocity Protocol** outline.  
4. Prepare **pilot telemetry scaffold** for S7-S3.
