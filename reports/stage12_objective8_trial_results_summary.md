# Stage 12 — Objective 8  
## External Trial Execution + Feedback Capture  
**Trial Results Summary**

---

## 0. Scope & Intent

**Objective:**  
Validate that external users (non-developers) can run the Owlume Trial Kit end-to-end with minimal guidance, while capturing measurable friction, failure modes, and time-to-first-success (TTFS).

**What this trial is:**  
- A truth-seeking execution test  
- A validation of the *trial surface*, not internal architecture

**What this trial is not:**  
- A demo  
- A marketing exercise  
- A feature evaluation

---

## 1. Trial Parameters

- **Trial window:** (start date → end date)
- **Number of testers:** N =
- **Instructions used:** Quickstart (unmodified)
- **Canonical command:**

## 2. Tester Matrix

| Tester ID | Role / Background | OS | Python Version | Outcome (Success / Fail) | TTFS (min) | Assistance Used |
|----------|------------------|----|----------------|--------------------------|------------|------------------|
| T1 | | | | | | |
| T2 | | | | | | |
| T3 | | | | | | |
| T4 (opt) | | | | | | |
| T5 (opt) | | | | | | |

**Notes:**
- *TTFS = t_success − t0*
- *“Assistance Used” must be “None” for at least one successful tester to pass Objective 8.*

## 3. Outcome Summary

- **Total testers:**  
- **Successful completions:**  
- **Success rate:**  
- **Median TTFS:**  
- **TTFS range:**  

**Key acceptance checks**
- ☐ ≥ 3 external testers  
- ☐ ≥ 1 zero-assistance success  
- ☐ ≥ 2 OS environments  
- ☐ All failures logged with full console output

## 6. What Worked Better Than Expected

List any elements that:
- caused *less* confusion than anticipated
- helped users recover from errors
- made Owlume’s purpose clearer than expected

---

## 7. Value Comprehension Signals

Based on tester feedback:

- **Did testers understand what Owlume is doing?**
- ☐ Clearly
- ☐ Partially
- ☐ Not at all

- **Most common misconception:**  
- **Most common “aha” moment:**

## 8. Fix Backlog (Trial-Surface Only)

> Scope limited to documentation, robustness, error handling, and clarity.  
> No feature expansion.

| Priority | Fix Title | Category | Effort (S/M/L) | Owner | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|----------------|-------|-------|
| P1 | | | | | |
| P2 | | | | | |
| P3 | | | | | |
| P4 | | | | | |
| P5 | | | | | |

## 9. Decision Gate

**Based on evidence above, the decision is:**

☐ GO — widen external trials  
☐ CONDITIONAL GO — fix top blockers, then retry  
☐ NO-GO — trial surface not ready  
☐ RE-SCOPE — expectations or audience misaligned

**Rationale (concise, evidence-based):**

---

## 10. Objective 8 Closure Statement

Objective 8 is considered:
☐ COMPLETE  
☐ NOT COMPLETE  

**Completion criteria met:**  
(list which acceptance criteria were satisfied)

**Outstanding gaps (if any):**

---

## 11. Next Objective Recommendation

Recommended next step:
- ☐ Objective 9 — Expanded Trial / Pilot
- ☐ Hardening Sprint (Objective 8.1)
- ☐ Documentation Rewrite
- ☐ Trial Redesign
- ☐ Pause / Re-evaluate

**Why:**
